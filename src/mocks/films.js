    plot: `In 1890s London, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden work as shills for a magician, under the mentorship of John Cutter, an engineer who designs stage magic (a job termed ingenieur in the film).

After the performance, as they watch the old man hobble in his frail state into a carriage Borden explains to Angier that no one can detect the method because the Chinese magician's real trick was to appear weak and feeble at all times off-stage to conceal that he had the immense physical strength needed to perform the illusion.`,
